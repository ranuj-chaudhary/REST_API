/*
A few things you have to be aware of when using a cache:
- you always have to make sure that the data inside the cache is up to date
 because you don't want to serve outdated data
 
- while the first request is being processed and the cache is about to
 be filled and more requests are coming in, you have to decide if you 
 delay those other requests and serve the data from the cache or if they 
 also receive data straight from the database like the first request

- it's another component inside your infrastructure if you're choosing a
 distributed cache like Redis (so you have to ask yourself if it really 
 makes sense to use it)
